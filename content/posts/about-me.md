## My Interests
### New York Mets
A lifelong Mets fan, I am an avid follower of the team. I do my best to watch every game available, and the games I do not watch, I have the play by play on my phone to keep up with it. My favorite player of all time is David Wright, and currently I am big on [Francisco Lindor](https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/l/lindofr01.shtml)(obviously) and [Brett Baty](https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/b/batybr01.shtml)(A Syracuse legend). I enjoy more than just watching baseball, I love the statistical element of the game as well. Using websites such as [Baseball-Reference](https://www.baseball-reference.com), [Fangraphs](https://www.fangraphs.com), and [BaseballSavant](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com), I can stay up to date on my player evaluations. I consider myself to be an informed fan, and making sure I have the facts right is an important part of that, and the above website help me do just that.
