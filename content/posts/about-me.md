## My Interests
### New York Mets
A lifelong Mets fan, I am an avid follower of the team. I do my best to watch every game available, and the games I do not watch, I have the play by play on my phone to keep up with it. My favorite player of all time is David Wright, and currently I am big on [Francisco Lindor](https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/l/lindofr01.shtml)(obviously) and [Brett Baty](https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/b/batybr01.shtml)(A Syracuse legend). I enjoy more than just watching baseball, I love the statistical element of the game as well. Using websites such as [Baseball-Reference](https://www.baseball-reference.com), [Fangraphs](https://www.fangraphs.com), and [BaseballSavant](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com), I can stay up to date on my player evaluations. I consider myself to be an informed fan, and making sure I have the facts right is an important part of that, and the above website help me do just that.

### Video Games
I have always enjoyed playing video games, primarily on Playstation. I mostly play single player games, or games with single player options. Some of my favorite games of all time are:
- Borderlands 2
- Portal 2
- Red Dead Redemption 2
- Elden Ring
- Skyrim
- Civilization V
- Control
- No Man's Sky

### Anime
I first got intoduced to anime by a cousin of mine with his box set of Dragon Ball Z DVD's. Since then, I have loved wathcing anime, and since my sophmore year of college, reading manga. I typically prefer basic battle shonen series, but I also love some smaller series with more throughtfull stories. 
Some of my favorite are:
- The Dragon Ball series (Z, GT, Super, Daima)
- Bleach
- Naruto
- Steins;Gate
- Terror In Resonance
- Fullmetal Achemist Brotherhood
- Attack on Titan
- Code Geass
- Cowboy Bebop
- Hunter X Hunter

### New York Jets
A source of constant anguish for me is my decisnion to support the New York Jets. A team so poorly run it hurts, they are constantly at the bottom of the league, and when they are half decent, it is never enough. I wish I could go back to kid me and tell him to pick a better team, especially considering my Dad is a Bills fan and both my brothers are Patriots fans. There's not much to talk about regarding the Jets, so I do not expect to mention them often.
