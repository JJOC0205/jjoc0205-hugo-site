## INTRO

This is my first attempt at a post on this site. This will mostly be used for testing and to check fonts, *emphasis*, and other stuff. Eventually I will better organize this site to be more conceise.
Looking to have 3-5 main tabs, one for CS stuff, one for the Mets (Maybe an extra for the Jets), and one for anime/video game reviews (May be turned into 2 seperate tabs).
