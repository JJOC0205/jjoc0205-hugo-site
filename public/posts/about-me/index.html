<h2 id="my-interests">My Interests</h2>
<h3 id="new-york-mets">New York Mets</h3>
<p>A lifelong Mets fan, I am an avid follower of the team. I do my best to watch every game available, and the games I do not watch, I have the play by play on my phone to keep up with it. My favorite player of all time is David Wright, and currently I am big on <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/l/lindofr01.shtml">Francisco Lindor</a>(obviously) and <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/b/batybr01.shtml">Brett Baty</a>(A Syracuse legend). I enjoy more than just watching baseball, I love the statistical element of the game as well. Using websites such as <a href="https://www.baseball-reference.com">Baseball-Reference</a>, <a href="https://www.fangraphs.com">Fangraphs</a>, and <a href="https://baseballsavant.mlb.com">BaseballSavant</a>, I can stay up to date on my player evaluations. I consider myself to be an informed fan, and making sure I have the facts right is an important part of that, and the above website help me do just that.</p>
