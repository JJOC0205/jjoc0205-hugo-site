  <h2 id="subway-series">Subway Series</h2>
<p>The 2025 Subway Series started between the Mets and Yankees yesterday. Game 1 went all for the yankees, as Tylor Megill struggled immesnly with his command in the early innings. Giving up around 4 runs early put the Mets in a hole they were unable to get out of. The large strain on the bullpen was also a huge downside. Soto played good, with 3 walks, however he had a poor throw from right field which allowed a run to score. Other than that there were no big showings.</p>
<p>Today for game 2, the game went a lot better, with Canning throwing 5-1/3 good innings, only giving up 2 runs over that stretch. A pair of soft hits allowed 2 men to get on base, forcing him out of the game. Brazoban came in clutch, as he has done all year long, giving them 1-2/3 solid innings. Early in the game, I thought Baty had hit a grand slam, but the ball died in the mid outfield to end the inning. Later in the game, he got thrown out on a close play at the plate while trying to score from first on a Taylor double. But a pair of walks and an infield hit allowed a run to score to take the lead. Diaz then came in for the 9th and was lights out, striking out Aaron &ldquo;Mr.May&rdquo; Judge to end the game.</p>
