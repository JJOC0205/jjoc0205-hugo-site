      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;subway-series&#34;&gt;Subway Series&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The 2025 Subway Series started between the Mets and Yankees yesterday. Game 1 went all for the yankees, as Tylor Megill struggled immesnly with his command in the early innings. Giving up around 4 runs early put the Mets in a hole they were unable to get out of. The large strain on the bullpen was also a huge downside. Soto played good, with 3 walks, however he had a poor throw from right field which allowed a run to score. Other than that there were no big showings.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
